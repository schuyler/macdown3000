# MathJax in Code Blocks

## Regular Math

This math should be processed: \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \)

## Math in Code Block

```
This math should NOT be processed: \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \)
And display math: $$ E = mc^2 $$
```

## Math in Inline Code

This math in inline code should be literal: `\( x^2 \)` and `$$ E = mc^2 $$`

## More Regular Math

Display math should be processed:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$
