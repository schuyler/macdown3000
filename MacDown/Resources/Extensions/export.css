/* HTML Export & Screen Preview - Paragraph Text Wrapping
 *
 * This stylesheet provides universal text wrapping styles for HTML exports
 * and screen preview. It ensures long words and URLs wrap properly within
 * their containers instead of causing horizontal overflow.
 *
 * Issue: #30
 * Based on: PR #1320 from MacDownApp/macdown by @radicm
 *
 * Note: This file loads LAST in the stylesheet cascade to ensure it can
 * override theme defaults when necessary.

/* Main paragraph wrapping - handles regular prose with long words/URLs */
p {
    word-break: break-word;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* List items - ensure long text in lists wraps properly */
li {
    word-break: break-word;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Table cells - handle long content in tables */
td, th {
    word-break: break-word;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Blockquotes - ensure quoted content wraps */
blockquote {
    word-break: break-word;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Description list definitions */
dd {
    word-break: break-word;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Body fallback - catch any edge cases via inheritance */
body {
    word-wrap: break-word;  /* Legacy property for older browsers */
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* NOTE: Code elements are NOT targeted here.
 * Code blocks use different wrapping rules (white-space: pre-wrap)
 * which are handled by print.css for PDF exports.
 * For screen preview and HTML export, code blocks maintain their
 * natural overflow behavior with horizontal scrolling.
