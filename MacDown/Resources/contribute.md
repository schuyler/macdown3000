# Contributing to MacDown 3000

MacDown 3000 is open source and is a volunteer effort. This means that it depends on people to give some of their free time to improve it and make it even better.

If you are reading this, then you are probably curious or want to contribute in some way. Read on to see how you can do so.

## Getting the Source Code

MacDown 3000 is hosted on GitHub:

https://github.com/schuyler/macdown3000

Here you can get the source code, read through the issues and start contributing.

## But, I am not a Coder

Contribution is not limited to software developers, since there are other ways you can help. For example, contributing towards documentation, translation and support.

If you want to help translate, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss adding or updating translations for your language.
