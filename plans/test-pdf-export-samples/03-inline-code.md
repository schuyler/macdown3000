# Inline Code Test

This paragraph contains inline code that is quite long: `veryLongFunctionName(withManyParameters, andMoreParameters, evenMoreParameters, keepingGoing, almostDone, thisIsReallyLong)` and it should wrap within the paragraph.

Another test: `https://github.com/schuyler/macdown3000/this/is/a/very/long/url/that/should/wrap/properly/in/pdf/exports/without/breaking/the/layout`

And here's some more inline code in a sentence: `someObject.propertyName.anotherProperty.yetAnotherProperty.andOneMoreProperty.finalProperty` should wrap nicely.

## Expected Result

Inline code should wrap within paragraphs, no overflow beyond page margins, and maintain monospace font styling.
