        <h2>About MacDown 3000</h2>
        <p>
            In 2025, there's still a need for a modern, lightweight Markdown editor for macOS with live preview capabilities.
            MacDown 3000 continues the legacy started by Chen Luo's <strong>Mou</strong> and carried forward by
            Tzu-ping Chung's <strong>MacDown</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            MacDown 3000—or "MD3K"—is essentially <em>MacDown Continued</em>. Our focus is on keeping MacDown up to date
            with modern Markdown best practices and maintaining compatibility with current library dependencies. We aim to
            support the widest range of modern macOS versions from macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) onwards, focusing exclusively on
            Apple Silicon.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project honors the original intentions and contributions of both Mou and MacDown while ensuring that
            this valuable tool remains available and actively maintained for today's Mac users.
        </p>

            <h3>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Mou</strong> by Chen Luo was the pioneering Markdown editor that inspired this lineage of tools.
                Its elegant design and focus on simplicity set the standard for Markdown editors on macOS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>MacDown</strong> by Tzu-ping Chung (2014–2021) carried the torch forward as an open source project,
                proving that great software can be both free and community-driven. Icon design by Matt Zanchelli.
            </p>
            <p>
                MacDown 3000 continues this tradition, committed to keeping this valuable tool alive and relevant for
                modern Mac users.

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>About MacDown 3000</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What is MacDown 3000?</h4>
                <p>MacDown 3000 is a continuation of the MacDown open source Markdown editor for macOS. It maintains the spirit and functionality of the original MacDown while ensuring compatibility with modern macOS versions and Apple Silicon processors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why does MacDown 3000 exist?</h4>
                <p>While MacDown was last actively maintained through 2021, there's still a strong need for a lightweight, native Markdown editor on macOS. MacDown 3000 keeps this valuable tool alive by updating dependencies, maintaining compatibility with modern macOS, and ensuring it runs optimally on Apple Silicon Macs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How is MacDown 3000 different from the original MacDown?</h4>
                <p>MacDown 3000 focuses on maintaining the core functionality while updating for modern systems. Key differences include Apple Silicon optimization, updated library dependencies, compatibility with the latest macOS versions (11.0+), and ongoing maintenance to keep the project alive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Will you support Intel Macs?</h4>
                <p>No. MacDown 3000 is exclusively for Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs running macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later. This allows us to focus on optimizing for modern hardware and maintaining a lean codebase. If you have an Intel Mac, the original MacDown may still work for you.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>Installation & Compatibility</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>macOS says you are an unidentified developer!</h4>
                <p>MacDown 3000 is not signed with a paid Apple developer certificate. You can override this by going to System Settings → Privacy & Security, finding the blocked app message, and clicking "Open Anyway". Alternatively, right-click the app and choose "Open" the first time you launch it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What are the system requirements?</h4>
                <p>MacDown 3000 requires macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later and an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, etc.) processor. Intel Macs are not supported.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Do you support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)?</h4>
                <p>Yes! Enable Tables, Fenced code blocks, Strikethrough, and Autolink in Markdown preferences, plus Task list syntax in Rendering preferences for complete GFM support.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Will there be a VIM mode?</h4>
                <p>No. Implementing VIM mode would require replacing macOS's built-in text editing features, which conflicts with the project's philosophy of leveraging native macOS capabilities. Consider using VIM plugins for Markdown or editors like Sublime Text with VIM extensions if you need VIM keybindings.</p>
