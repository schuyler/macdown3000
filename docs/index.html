        <h2>About MacDown 3000</h2>
        <p>
            In 2025, there's still a need for a modern, lightweight Markdown editor for macOS with live preview capabilities.
            MacDown 3000 continues the legacy started by Chen Luo's <strong>Mou</strong> and carried forward by
            Tzu-ping Chung's <strong>MacDown</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            MacDown 3000—or "MD3K"—is essentially <em>MacDown Continued</em>. Our focus is on keeping MacDown up to date
            with modern Markdown best practices and maintaining compatibility with current library dependencies. We aim to
            support the widest range of modern macOS versions from macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) onwards, focusing exclusively on
            Apple Silicon.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project honors the original intentions and contributions of both Mou and MacDown while ensuring that
            this valuable tool remains available and actively maintained for today's Mac users.
        </p>

            <h3>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Mou</strong> by Chen Luo was the pioneering Markdown editor that inspired this lineage of tools.
                Its elegant design and focus on simplicity set the standard for Markdown editors on macOS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>MacDown</strong> by Tzu-ping Chung (2014–2021) carried the torch forward as an open source project,
                proving that great software can be both free and community-driven. Icon design by Matt Zanchelli.
            </p>
            <p>
                MacDown 3000 continues this tradition, committed to keeping this valuable tool alive and relevant for
                modern Mac users.
